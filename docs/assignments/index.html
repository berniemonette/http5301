        <h2>Reading summaries</h2>
        <p>Every week there is something to read for this course. WE will talk about this in class and you will write a brief, 250 to 500 word, summary for your blog. Once you have done so; send me an email to let me know it is there. What should you write about?</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A key insight into the topic: a new connection you have made.</li>
            <li>Something you did not know before. A "Hmmph, I did not know that" sort of idea.</li>
            <li>Whether this is something you can use later.</li>
            <li>A brief description of the topic if all else fails.</li>
         </ul>
        <p>These are due every week and are worth 25% of your mark.</p>

      <h2>For your midterm assignment, write a usability test plan.</h2>

      <p>Your plan should be written as though you are seeking approval/buy-in. As such, you should be providing rationale for all of your choices. For example, it is not enough to simply list your metrics; you must explain how those metrics will be used to meet your objective. Simply put, you must explain the <strong>WHY</strong> for all your choices.This is due the week of May 20th by email. You can work on this with one other person if you wish. Make sure you tell me about it and that both people are clearly identified in the report.</p>

      <h3>Your test plan must address the following:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Objective</li>
        <li>Scope</li>
        <li>Participants</li>
        <li>Methods</li>
        <li>Metrics</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your plan <em>may</em> include the following sections:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Executive summary</li>
        <li>Schedule and location</li>
        <li>Equipment</li>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <li>Roles</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For a detailed explanation of both of the above lists, see the course notes.</p>

      <h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>

      <p>This is not an instance where the longest submission will get the highest grade. When seeking buy-in, it is important that your plan be clear and concise. As above, this test plan is not written strictly as documentation, but is meant to be persuasive. Write it as a professional usability document, but one that is accessible to non-technical readers.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, write the test plan that is best for the test. Include information that is relevant to the <strong>type</strong> and <strong>scope</strong> of the test that you have chosen.</p>

      <p>Feel free to work from the usability.gov template, or to base your work on one of the examples. Take care, though, that this fits with the test you are planning.</p>

         <h2>Test Summaries</h2>
        <p>As a precursor to your final report you will provide the test summaries. These will be a record of the actual test and how it was conducted. If you rested five subjects then you would have five test summaries. Think of this as being the raw data for your final report. A non-exhaustive list of topics for the summary is:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Describe the test conditions: feature being tested, the location, the instructions.</li>
            <li>Whether consent was obtained from the subject.</li>
            <li>Your observations of the subject while taking the test.</li>
            <li>Who the subject was: their demographic information (but not personal information).</li>
            <li>Quotes from the subject if they said anything relevant or valuable to your understanding of the test.</li>
            <li>Feedback from the subject - questionnaire responses as well.</li>
            <li>Whether there were any variations from on subject to the next.</li>
         </ol>
        <p>Each team member will be responsible for submitting one test summary.</p>
