            <p>The class structure is to talk about new stuff in our joint, two section, very large, class. Then in each section we will do things that will build towards a final project. That project is a completely performed, recorded, and analysed usability test.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic on the feature.</h3>
            <p>Now that you have your features chosen what do you think about them? How do they work? What kind of language is being used? Does it work in the way you think it should work? If you had to advise your ciient - what woud you say? If you had to provide feedback to the developer - what would you talk about? Each of the features should have a requirements document (remember two weeks ago?) how does the feature work in comparison to that document?</p>
	        
            <p>As a developer you are bringing your expertise to bear on an application. Using PURE for example - how would you split up the feature into discrete tasks? Then rate those tasks as:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The step can be accomplished easily by the target user.</li>
                <li>The step requires some degree of cognitive load by the target user but can usually be complete.</li>
                <li>The step is difficult for the target user: due to complexity or confusion. Some target users may fail on this step.</li>
            </ol>
	   
            <p>This may not come easily at first - but keep trying! It is a framework to put your thoughts in so that you can use them later. And do so in a way that you can build your skill over time.</p>

                <h3>User goals</h3>
				<p>The question you are answering here is: why would a target user want to use this feature? What do they hope to get out of this interaction? How do you know this?Does the feature outline this clearly? How is the feature labelled for example? </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the user goals for a donation feature?</li>
                    <li>What are the user goals for a FAQ feature?</li>
                    <li>What are the user goals for a volunteer feature?</li>
                </ul>
                
	        <p>In the back of your mind - think about user stories and how they would apply here.</p>

    <section id="client-goals">
	    <div class="grid-x">
	        <div class="cell large-6 large-offset-3 medium-10 medium-offset-1">
                <h3>Client goals</h3>
				<p>What does the client want from this feature? How will they know they have gotten their money's worth? How does the feature work to insure that their goals are met? What is the business logic? Remember Web sites can generate money, save money, save time, and increase communicty connections among other things. So what are those things?</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the client goals for a donation feature?</li>
                    <li>What are the client goals for a FAQ feature?</li>
                    <li>What are the client goals for a volunteer feature?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the client is to receive money and the user goal is to give money - are these goals the same? How would you describe the goals around increasing community connections? How would you describe a goal for improving or maintaining a reputation?</p>

    <section id="scenarios">

	        <div class="cell large-6 large-offset-3 medium-10 medium-offset-1">
                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
				<p>At this point you want to describe how you see the user using the feature to achieve both sets of goals: client and user. Your user stories developed for the feature should help you to begin constructing the scenarios needed to test the feature. Think of it this way: You will be asking someone to use the feature in a neutral manner. That is to say that they will use it and if they can use it and feel good about using it then the feature is a success. If they can't use it then the feature needs things to be fixed. So if a target user cannot use the feature, cannot accomplish the scenario then something has to change.</p>
